    Your report should contain a brief, 100 word abstract describing what is contained in 
    the document and what you did. {\bf Don't forget 6 pages max}.

\section{Misc Notes While Analyzing the data}\label{sec:Notes}
\textbf{TODO: Remove later}
I am currently trying to visualize the data more on my own with the packages provided by matplotlib and plotly.
It is confusing to me a bit since we are really visualizing something that has 4 dimensions. There are signals or values which are occurring in a 3 dimensional space.

\section{Introduction and Overview}\label{sec:Introduction}
\textbf{TODO: Actually edit this later}
Here you will give a brief introduction to the problem you solved. Including 
some discussion of relevant literature and background. 

Make sure you use the correct citation commands (i.e., \texttt{$\backslash$cite}) to keys 
from your bib file like this \cite{example-article-citation}. If you want 
to cite more than one reference simply use \cite{example-article-citation, example-book-citation}. You can grab latex citations 
from \href{https://scholar.google.com}{Google Scholar}. Just keep in mind that they often 
need to be cleaned up.

\section{Theoretical Background}\label{sec:theory}
\textbf{TODO: Actually edit this later}
You dedicate this section to the theoretical background of the methods and frameworks 
that you used in your homework. This is not meant to reproduce material from the lectures
 or references you used but rather to demonstrate your understanding of the 
 mathematical foundations of the methods and algorithms. You can create equations like this 
 \begin{equation*}
     f(x) = \int_A \sin( \pi x) dx.
 \end{equation*}
 You do not need to label your equations unless they are referenced in the text. In that 
 case simply use 
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:meaningful-label}
      - \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = \sin ( \pi x).
 \end{equation}
Also look up the \texttt{align} or \texttt{aligned} environments if you want multi-line 
equations. You can then reference your equations in text using the $\backslash$\texttt{eqref}
command as such \eqref{eq:meaningful-label}. 

\section{Algorithm Implementation and Development}\label{sec:algorithms}
\textbf{TODO: Actually edit this later}
Here you discuss the algorithms and software packages that you used. Not much to it. 
Just make sure you cite the packages properly and avoid including code. 
You are welcome to use \LaTeX packages that are specifically designed to show 
algorithms such \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Algorithms}{as this}, but it is 
not always worth the effort and real estate. 


\section{Computational Results}\label{sec:results}
\textbf{TODO: Actually edit this later}
In our work to locate and track the suspected submarine in the puget sound, it was of utmost importance to be able to think through the dimensionality of this problem.
We are tracking a signal from a location in 3 dimensional space, which inherently becomes a 4 dimensional problem.
I had to come up with methods of thinking about what it meant to average something that is 3 dimensional across its fourth dimension (time).
I had to visualize things in lower dimensions in my mind to make sense of the actions that we need to take.


\noindent
One thing that helped was taking slices of the average frequencies across time to confirm what we found by calculation.
As seen in Figure \ref{fig:f1} by looking at the slices corresponding to the location of the max frequency in our cube of frequencies.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../visualizations/visualizing_dominant_frequency.png}
 	\caption{\textbf{TODO: increase font size and give a detailed caption.}}\label{fig:f1}
\end{figure}

This helped confirm that I had identified the correct dominant frequency at which to center the gaussian filter to help us eliminate the noise.
Furthermore we visualized the path of the of the submarine in Figure \ref{fig:f2}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../visualizations/submarine_static_3d.png}
 	\caption{\textbf{TODO: give a detailed caption.}}\label{fig:f2}
\end{figure}

Moreover, I was able to generate several other important visualizations in gif form which are viewable on my Github.
\href{https://github.com/hunter-lybbert/uw-central/blob/data-analysis-hw-1/data_analysis/hw_01/visualizations/submarine_trajectory_3d.gif}{This} is the animation of the 3 dimensional path and \href{https://github.com/hunter-lybbert/uw-central/blob/data-analysis-hw-1/data_analysis/hw_01/visualizations/submarine_trajectory_2d.gif}{this} is the animation of the path in just the $x$-$y$ plane ($z = 0$).

You will most definitely need tables and figures. So here is an example. 

\begin{table}[htp]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{| l | c|c | r |}
         \hline
         row 1 & column 1  & column 2  \\ \hline
         row 2 & column 1 & column 2 \\ 
         row 3 & column 1 & column 2 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Don't forget to include a caption for your table. Say a few words about what is 
    being shown.}
    \label{tab:meaningful-label}
\end{table}

Make sure your table is labeled and referenced withing the text using $\backslash$\texttt{ref} as such Table~\ref{tab:meaningful-label}. In fact, you can 
use $\backslash$\texttt{ref} to cite anything else in the document such as 
sections (ex. Section~\ref{sec:Introduction}). This will create hyperlinks in your 
pdf after compilation and automatically update the numbers and tags whenever you change 
anything. 

Figures are very similar to tables. Here's an example: 

%\begin{figure}[htp]
%    \centering
%    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{./Figs/fig1.pdf}
%    \caption{Include a descriptive caption for your figure. Also make sure all 
%    legends, axis labels, and titles are large enough to be readable. You might have 
%    to reproduce the plots from Python or MATLAB with larger fonts for this purpose. It 
%    can be annoying the first time you do it but it is crucial.}
%    \label{fig:meaningful-label}
%\end{figure}

You may also need to include multiple figures: 

%\begin{figure}
%    \centering
%    \begin{subfigure}[b]{.3\textwidth}
%    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./Figs/fig1.pdf}
%    \caption{First subfigure}
%    \label{subfig:first}
%    \end{subfigure}
%    \begin{subfigure}[b]{.3\textwidth}
%    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./Figs/fig2.pdf}
%    \caption{First subfigure}
%    \label{subfig:second}
%    \end{subfigure}
%    \begin{subfigure}[b]{.3\textwidth}
%    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./Figs/fig3.pdf}
%    \caption{First subfigure}
%    \label{subfig:third}
%    \end{subfigure}
%    \caption{Caption for entire figure. You don't need to use captions for subfigs so 
%    feel free to eliminate the subcaption texts to just have the A, B, C labels.}
%    \label{fig:meaningful-label-2}
%\end{figure}

Once again, make sure all your figures are referenced like Figure~\ref{fig:meaningful-label}
or Figure~\ref{subfig:first} in the text body of the report and discussed 
in detail. This is where you will make observations about your results and we will 
look at these very closely. 

Also note, I am using PDF figures. These give you the best looking graphs but PNG works 
well too. I advise staying away from JPG as it always looks weird and low quality.]
Both Python and MATLAB can output figures in PDF or PNG.

\section{Summary and Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
Wrap up your report with a brief summary of what you did and what you discovered. 
Finish with some conclusions and possibly future directions if any.
