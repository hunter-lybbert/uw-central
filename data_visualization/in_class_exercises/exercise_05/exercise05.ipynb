    "Here's the (fictional) story behind our dataset for this activity: Maria, Glendale, Richa, and Michael became friends in their first year of college, and are all graduating with bachelors degrees in business and finance. In their freshman year, they made a silly bet that they could beat each other with their own hand-picked stock portfolios. They recorded the stock prices at the time (closing stock prices on November 8, 2019), and vowed to compare their results four years later. The big day has finally come!\n",

    "For the curious, here are some notes on each friend's stock selections:\n",
    "* Maria went for general brand recognition (with some biases in favor of her own lifestyle)\n",
    "* Glendale, being a CS double major, feels that the US economy is heavily focused on tech, so she favored tech stocks\n",
    "* Richa believes the money movers are the real money makers, and picked only finance-related stocks\n",
    "* Michael---a self-professed \"true Washingtonian\"---chose to place his faith in some of the biggest companies in the great state of Washington."
